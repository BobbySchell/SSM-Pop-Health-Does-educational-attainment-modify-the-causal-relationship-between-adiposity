Instructions for Section
---------------

This section is based on the data in "Combining Genetic and Phenotypic Data," which involved transposing the matrix of genetic variants for each chromosome and using some regular expressions to get the ID variable formatted correctly. It seems to have gone smoothly based on sanity checks.

We manually looked at which allele was the effect allele (in this case, which one resulted in increased BMI) in Locke et al. and then counted the number of each of these alleles by variant for each individual. The results presented in Effect Allele Frequency suggest that this went well.
